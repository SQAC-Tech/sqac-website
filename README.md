# How to contribute:
## To start working,

### 1) Make sure you have git setup, and clone the repository from Github to your VSCode.

### 2) Create your own BRANCH using:
`git checkout -B <your-branch-name>`

for example, if I’m working on theme, I would name my branch with my initials (s b) followed by the type of work and title:
`git checkout -B sb/feat/theme`

Your branch is where you will be pushing your changes as commits, which will later on get merged with the main branch.

### 3) As you have written your code, you can push the changes to the remote (the version present online on github) repo.

i) stage the changes:  `git add .`

ii) to commit the changes: `git commit -m <commit-message>`

iii) push: `git push origin <your-branch-name>`

Then go to GitHub and create your Push Request (PR) by writing the description of your work, and attach some screenshots of your testing. 

### 4) We will be reviewing your changes, suggesting edits, and merging it to the main branch on satisfaction.
